# Examples of homework tasks from the past

I've listed here a small collection of little tasks I've done as homework in the past. 

## Introduction to Data Science
The main focus of this course was the group project which you can find from my pinned repositories.
I have included one homework example here of raw data processing which is quite similar to what I've done in Language Technology courses as well.

## Language Technology
There are several examples I could show here but I've so far chosen two that are slightly more complex. Other work for Language Technology courses are the German to Swiss German translator which uses xfst tools and a rule-based approach, and the emmiagata project which is a search engine tool that uses Solr combined with simple Python to search and analyse Wikipedia data.

## Computer Science
I have only started the courses in January 2018, and the language here is Java which is new to me. The work I've done with Java is therefore still very simple, but I have included a couple of examples of what I've done so far. I will update the portfolio with more complex examples as knowledge of Java broadens.
