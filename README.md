# Examples of homework tasks from the past

I've listed here a collection of tasks I've done as homework in the past. 

## Introduction to Web Development and Programming, 2020
I took this Aalto University course in spring 2020 through FITech, and as the name would suggest, it was an introductory level course. This course was worth 3 ECTS points and it covered the basic principles of building a simple online service. Utilised technologies included JavaScript, Node.js, HTML/CSS. 

## Machine Learning with Python, 2020
I took this Aalto University course through FITech over spring 2020 to brush up my Python and Machine Learning skills. The course was worth 2 ECTS and had six rounds that were published over three months.
I have included here a student task from round 5, to give an idea of the kind of tasks and topics that the course had. I finished the course with second highest grade.

## Computer Science, 2018
I have studied Java on two courses held by University of Helsinki, Introduction to Programming (5 ECTS, highest grade) and Advanced Course in Programming (5 ECTS, second highest grade), both in 2018. The Java examples I have to show are fairly simple, but they show that I have a good basic understanding of this language which can easily be built up.

## Introduction to Data Science, 2017
This course was held by the CS department of University of Helsinki in 2017.
The course was worth 5 ECTS and I finished the course with second highest grade.
The main task of this course was the group project which you can find from my pinned repositories.
I have included one homework example here of raw data processing which is quite similar to what I've done in Language Technology courses as well.

## Language Technology, 2016-2017
There are several examples I could show here but I've so far chosen two that are slightly more complex. Other work for Language Technology courses are the German to Swiss German translator which uses xfst tools and a rule-based approach, and the emmiagata project which is a search engine tool that uses Solr combined with simple Python to search and analyse Wikipedia data.
