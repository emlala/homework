## Language Technology
I studied Language Technology in 2016-2018, and finished the basic and intermediate studies (50 ECTS). I've included two different projects here.

### Noun Phrase chunker for raw English text

In this task, I needed to design a noun phrase (NP) chunker for just any English text. As test data, I used a recent news story from the BBC. I used a Naive Bayes classifier to train my chunker.

This assignment demonstrates well the type of work I did during my Language Technology studies, combining simple machine learning methods with linguistic analysis tasks.

### Text Mining

The purpose of this exercise was to try out text mining from any website of our choise with BeautifulSoup. I choose to mine weather forecasts from http://www.foreca.fi.
