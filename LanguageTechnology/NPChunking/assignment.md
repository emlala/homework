In this task, I needed to design a noun phrase (NP) chunker for just any English text. As test data, I used a recent news story from the BBC. I used a Naive Bayes classifier to train my chunker.

This assignment demonstrates well the type of work I did during my Language Technology studies, combining simple machine learning methods with linguistic analysis tasks.
