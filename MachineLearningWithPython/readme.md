I took this Aalto University course through FITech over spring 2020 to brush up my Python and Machine Learning skills. 
The course was worth 2 ECTS and had six rounds that were published over three months. 

I have included here a student task from round 5, to give an idea of the kind of tasks and topics that the course had.
I finished the course with second highest grade.
