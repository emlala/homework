## Machine Learning with Python

I took this Aalto University course in spring 2020 to brush up my Python skills and it was great fun.

The exercise I've included here aimed to group customers based on their age and spending habit, to find out if there is any correlation between the two factors.

The dataset was not available for the students to download, but it contains data of the spending habits of customers of different ages.
Each data point had two values, age of the customer and the money spent.
