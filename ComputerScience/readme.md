## Computer Science Homework

In spring 2018 I did the basic studies in Computer Science (25 ESCTs) at the University of Helsinki. The studies included two Java programming courses, Introduction to Programming and Advanced Course in Programming. Having learned Python before, I found the courses quite easy and fun. 

I've included three examples from these courses, a "Mind Reader" that tries to "guess" your input, a program for trying out loops, and a dictionary program.
