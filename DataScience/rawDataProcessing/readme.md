## Introduction to Data Science

I took the Introduction to Data Science course in the University of Helsinki in autumn 2017. My largest project for this course was an explorative data analysis on tweets discussing the referendum of Catalonian independence. This project can be found in its own repository, I haven't included it in the homework section here.

However, here I have included another project from the course, an exercise on processing raw text data. This assignment was extremely similar to what I had done before on Language Technology courses.
