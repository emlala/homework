Introduction to Web Development

I took this course in spring 2020 to get acquainted with JavaScript and web development in general. 
I was already familiar with HTML and CSS thanks to a website hobby as a teenager, but it was very interesting to learn a little about what happens "behind".

The example I've included is a basic exercise for setting up a form server. 
I created a simple html form and a server that collects data through the form.
